            <p>Takealot officially launched in June 2011(Takealot Online 2024) and currently has built a successful reputation and company as most South Africans are aware of. Whether it be through personal experience of purchasing an item on the platform or shared knowledge from customer experiences. It became more relevant to millions during the pandemic as online retail stores saw a rise in becoming a necessity for the purchase of goods. Today, takealot.com is the leading ecommerce retailer in the country and one of the largest, most innovative companies in the retail industry on the whole continent (Takealot Online, 2024). The purpose of this essay is to create an analysis of the UX and UI design for the selected ecommerce website - Takealot.com. Its high usage serves as a worthy website to observe regarding its user interface and user experience as it would be expected that it is user friendly. Is that the reason why people keep coming back for more? Are there areas in which the website lacks usability? According to Bush (1945) there is an increase in complexity and sophistication of technology. Therefore, throughout the essay we will dive into these aspects in depth outlining modern UI and UX design in todayâ€™s digital landscape. </p>
            <p>User experience (UX) deals with the user behavior and feeling when using a website or app (Matt Ellis 2018). It refers to the meaningful experiences when users interact with a product or service. The process of design the UX involves different aspects of product development such as branding, function, usability, and the overall design. It helps to view it as a journey that the user experiences during an interaction of a product or service by asking questions about how the user is introduced to it. Whether it is through an advertisement, a blog, an app, and other possible platforms. Other questions to consider is what kind of experience the user has and taking note of how they feel after the interaction. The goal is to leave the user feeling fulfilled throughout a positive engagement during each interaction, whether it is to get a solution for a problem, helping the user find critical information, providing entertainment and many other factors (Columbia Engineering 2024). User interface (UI) is a specialization that focuses on the controls that people use to interact with a website or app. This design process may include controls such as button displays, gestures, widgets, text, sliders, images, and other interactive elements. These controls must be responsive, and the interface should be simple enough for an instantaneous experience in interactivity (Ellis 2018).</p>
