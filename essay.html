            <h1>Essay 1: UI & UX Analysis</h1>
            <p>Takealot officially launched in June 2011(Takealot Online 2024) and currently has built a successful reputation and company as most South Africans are aware of. Whether it be through personal experience of purchasing an item on the platform or shared knowledge from customer experiences. It became more relevant to millions during the pandemic as online retail stores saw a rise in becoming a necessity for the purchase of goods. Today, takealot.com is the leading ecommerce retailer in the country and one of the largest, most innovative companies in the retail industry on the whole continent (Takealot Online, 2024). The purpose of this essay is to create an analysis of the UX and UI design for the selected ecommerce website - Takealot.com. Its high usage serves as a worthy website to observe regarding its user interface and user experience as it would be expected that it is user friendly. Is that the reason why people keep coming back for more? Are there areas in which the website lacks usability? According to Bush (1945) there is an increase in complexity and sophistication of technology. Therefore, throughout the essay we will dive into these aspects in depth outlining modern UI and UX design in today’s digital landscape. </p>
            <p>User experience (UX) deals with the user behavior and feeling when using a website or app (Matt Ellis 2018). It refers to the meaningful experiences when users interact with a product or service. The process of design the UX involves different aspects of product development such as branding, function, usability, and the overall design. It helps to view it as a journey that the user experiences during an interaction of a product or service by asking questions about how the user is introduced to it. Whether it is through an advertisement, a blog, an app, and other possible platforms. Other questions to consider is what kind of experience the user has and taking note of how they feel after the interaction. The goal is to leave the user feeling fulfilled throughout a positive engagement during each interaction, whether it is to get a solution for a problem, helping the user find critical information, providing entertainment and many other factors (Columbia Engineering 2024). User interface (UI) is a specialization that focuses on the controls that people use to interact with a website or app. This design process may include controls such as button displays, gestures, widgets, text, sliders, images, and other interactive elements. These controls must be responsive, and the interface should be simple enough for an instantaneous experience in interactivity (Ellis 2018).</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture1.png">
            <p>When analyzing user experience at first, we can look at how we got to the website in the first place. It is easily accessible when searching for the website on google making the user find it with ease. The title and description clearly explain the purpose of using Takealot as it states that, “You can shop anything you want” and that it is “SA’s online leading store”. It highlights some of the main categories that the user may explore such as the daily deals, promos, vouchers, and exclusives. It promotes itself with high regard making it appear trustworthy for a customer. By the right side of the screen, sponsored ads are being promoted which gives a first glance of what kind of products are available on Takealot. It might be an opportunity for a customer to see what they are looking for and if it is found then it is easy to click on the specific product which directs you to the product on the website and they may choose to make a purchase right away. The same applies if the user searches for a specific product on google, the image of the product sold at Takealot will be displayed immediately. Although this analysis is not based on google, it is important to note that customers find products with ease which forms their user experience and that Takealot does a remarkable job at making its platform easily accessible for customers when searching for it, whilst promoting sponsored products that may be of interest and that encourages interaction. </p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture2.png">
            <p>On the first page of the website, the user is greeted with a large slideshow showcasing looped advertisements which is the first thing the user will see. This indicates that their advertisements are top priority in drawing customers in as flash sales, brands, special deals and programs are being promoted on this section. The advertisements continue by the right-side panel as you scroll down introducing the user to popular brands available on the platform and the sales or programs being promoted. This enables the user to click on an individual advert that is being shown on the fast-paced looped slideshow in case they missed it or did not catch it on time, and adding this to the user interface aids in making it a useful experience for the customer whilst giving the website more visual appeal. </p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/picture3.png">
            <p>When focusing back to the main front page, the Takealot logo is by the left corner of the page and is clearly visible. It is noticeable that their signature color is blue as seen on their logo, header, and footer. The blue is used for all the button interactions and their sale icons above products. The use of the same color shows their brand consistency. There is a psychological impact of color on human emotions and behavior as they elicit specific feelings and influence how people respond. Blue is associated with trust and calmness and often used in UI design to promote a sense of reliability and serenity. Financial and healthcare institutions may use this color in their UI to convey a sense of professionalism and security (Thang 2023). Therefore, Takealot may have blue as their main color because millions of people use their platform, and it needs to be presented in a professional manner so that customers trust their company enough to make financial transactions with them.</p>
            <p>The search UI is a framework that incorporates world class search experiences, and it is one of the most important aspects that influences user experience when visiting a website. It is a powerful system that connects users to their needs. It helps users stay engaged and find what they may be looking for. They may even discover more than they had intended (Kochummen 2023). Takealot has their search UI at the top of the page, encouraging users to see it clearly and use it as they need. It is a common action to search on Takealot and based on assumption, it may be the most used engine on their website as customers need to search for the items to find them before making a purchase. When you click on the search tab, it reveals a panel for trending items and for the user’s most recent search, which may be useful if the user is repurchasing an item and does not have to spend time retyping it as they may find it there. When the user types the first letters of the item they want to search for, it gives possible auto-filled options in bold that is generated to help the customer find products quicker and easier. Thus, having the search tab at the top of the header is an intentional decision for the user interface as customers use it the most and the user engagement is friendly making it more convenient and efficient by adding auto-generated tools and making it an effortless experience for the customer.</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture7.png">
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture8.png">
            <p>There is a “Shop by department” section that is placed by the left side panel on the first page and it lists all the departments that Takealot offers. When you hover over each one, it expands into categories and subcategories. There is something unappealing about this section and it may be the size of the text or that there is so much information that the user may ignore it and rather search for an item instead. It is useful to have it there as it shows all the departments, but it is not encouraging engagement and it is almost as if they have added this section for informative purposes and not to engage with it entirely. For instance, when the panels expand to reveal the categories, it is not clear which are the main categories and subcategories. They have made some titles bold, but it would have been clearer if they had increased the size to help distinguish the categories from the subcategories. However, using the same size for all categories and subcategories makes the interface difficult to engage with and it will confuse the user to the extent that they may ignore this section entirely.</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture9.png">
            <p>The use of shapes also influences psychological responses in users. Takealot mostly makes use of square shaped containers and buttons which adds to the idea of wanting to be presented in a professional and serious manner. Buttons are an essential element in UI and plays a crucial role in engagement. For example, rounded buttons have curved edges, and it is associated with a friendly and approachable aesthetic. On the other hand, rectangular buttons have sharp corners and straight edges, and it is associated with modernity and standardization. It is suitable for contemporary interfaces as it is modern, minimalistic, clean, and sleek (Baig 2023).</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/Picture10.png">
            <p>When the user engages with the products, the interface is neatly organized as the platform makes use of white backgrounds for all the product listings and it is displayed in an orderly fashion. According to Pereira (2021) the background you use determines the feel and message you want to convey to your customers and what you choose should let your customers efficiently evaluate your products as it builds the identity of your brand. Out of the multiple options for background choices, white still tops the list of being the perfect background for every product photo. This color brings out the best in every image and its plainness promotes consistency and a clean look (Pereira 2021). Takealot makes use of this technique for their user interface for these reasons specified and an addition to it is that makes the products stand out. When the product is selected, an overview of all the product is revealed. It displays the image/s, product title, price, product description and reviews. Therefore, providing the customer with all the product information. There are “Add to Cart” and “Add to list” buttons that the user may engage with if they are purchasing the item or storing the item into their wish-list. Another useful technique that encourages more engagement is listing related products as suggestions and these are shown in between the product information sections. It is intentionally there to persuade the customer to interact and see what else is available. When the customer adds the item to the cart, it notifies the customer by exposing a panel by the right side where they may go to their cart. Similar to almost every e-commerce website, they are directed to their cart and may proceed with their transaction by paying and providing shipping details. After successfully completing the transaction, the customer receives their package as expected. </p>

            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/16.png">
            <p>According to Lawson (2019) being technically accessible is good, but even better is to be usably accessible. An additional element on their user interface that influences user engagement is the left side panel when looking at the page after searching for a product. Takealot allows the customer to customize their preference for what should be presented on the page. It lists choices that the user may adjust according to price, brand, availability, ratings, deals, color, gender and much more. The way this UI is designed to make it quick and easy by providing choices with circles to click on and boxes to tick is an efficient way to help the customer effortlessly interact with the options.</p>

            <img class="essay-image" src="Images/last.png">
            <p>In conclusion, Takealot implements useful UI and UX principles that are relevant for their e-commerce website. Customers can trust their service as their user interface is presented professionally and designed to visually appear organized and clean. It influences their users to purchase items, engage with related products and customize their preference. The customer is provided with everything they need such as search engines, product information and promotions. Takealot ensures that they communicate as much as they should with the customer and assists with making their experience smooth and impactful.</p>

            <h1>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h1>
            <p>In our current digital age, the technical industry has shown characteristics and dynamics that are reminiscent of historical colonialism. The article, “Tech Colonialism Today” by Sareeta Amrute (2019) will be used as a framework to breakdown this phenomenon as it outlines how digital technologies perpetuate colonial relationships through hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative practices. This essay will further explore Google’s recent labour situation in global software development as the company has decided to move jobs to India and Mexico. There are other topics that contribute to digital colonialism that may be of interest as the way it affects South African developers will be challenged and discussed throughout. </p>
            <p>Before we get deeper into this discussion, it is important to know what ‘colonialism’ means. The term colonialism describes the practice of a country taking control of another country and the colonisers may occupy it for the benefit of profiting from its economy and resources. Essentially powerful countries would take advantage of vulnerable territories to gain economic and political power by exploiting the country and its people (Longley, 2021). This is exactly what Google is doing as it is responsible for laying off an estimation of two hundred employees from its core department including the key teams and engineering sector (Elias 2024). The company has decided to relocate core positions to India and Mexico, and it contributes to the problem of outsourcing skills in the global software industry to meet cost saving measures (Hess and Kapstein, 2023; Houseman, 2018). The company benefits from reduced labour costs and although the affected employees go through losing their jobs for outsourced employment, they also burdened with economic uncertainty (Kenney and Zysman, 2021). The new employees experience lower income rates and less benefits in comparison to the employees from these developed economies (Feenstra & Hanson, 2017). Thus, the exploitation of employees for financial gain, as profits will increase due to outsourcing cheaper skills in the technical industry, reflects digital colonialism.</p>
            <p>Let us further discuss digital colonialism as a concept and its characteristics described by Sareeta Amrute (2019). The concept explains how contemporary digital technologies indicates colonial relationships that are characterized by hierarchical structures, extractive practices, exploitative labour conditions, uneven consequences and malevolent paternalism. Hierarchical structures are used by technical companies to organize decision-making and high-value roles by maintaining power hierarchies. The important, beneficial roles are prioritized in developed nations and lower-value roles are outsourced, thus creating an inferior and superior labour dynamic (Amrute, 2019). The extraction process involves extracting data and information. Residents of all countries give up their private and personal information through the demands of their terms and conditions set online (Amrute, 2019). This caught my attention as it is often overlooked and may be a dangerous way to be manipulated into the extraction of your personal information and this is indicative of digital colonialism. Labour exploitation describes how outsourced workers often receive lower wages and experience poorer working conditions (Amrute 2019). As previously mentioned, this colonial relationship is common, and it is being used in large digital companies such as Google. Uneven consequences represent the idea that technological innovations are unevenly distributed (Amrute 2019). It ultimately leads to an imbalance of technical developments in oppressed or developing economies. The regions in which the technical innovations are introduced, benefit the most along with developed nations as it creates technical advancements in those economies. From a global perspective, many countries depend on developed economies to come up with the latest technologies. This dependency stems from historical colonialism which gave European and American economies power and control over other countries. </p>
            <p>They have maintained their reputation in creating the most innovative tech that once it is released, they control who gains access to it first. Meaning that they hold the power to how far a country can advance technically. There are several examples that supports this statement. In South Africa, it is common to experience a delay in digital services, automotive and consumer electronics. The latest car models from international brands often reach SA later than they reach developed economies such as Europe and the US. The manufacturers may be influenced to do this to focus on developed countries that have a more profitable market (BusinessTech, 2020). Apple’s latest iPhone models often arrive several months after their initial release in America, including other prioritized markets, and this affects consumers access to the latest electronics (MyBroadband, 2021). Digital Services for local business opportunities in e-commerce have been restricted as Instagram Shop and TikTok Shop remain unavailable in SA (Memeburn, 2022). Personally, this specific issue has affected my small business as it does not allow me to expand my market on social media platforms. The same applies to other local businesses who are encouraged to grow a market on social media, only to later discover that online shopping on these platforms have been restricted in specific regions. It is evident that there are software and platform restrictions as software updates and new platform features are delayed and often rolled out later in SA. Leading to users struggling to keep up to date with current global technological advancements (TechCentral, 2021). </p>
            <p>Digital colonialism has affected the South African software development industry as it has led to job displacement - which refers to involuntary job loss or termination due to economic or technological changes - and economic dependency (Bardhan and Kroll, 2016; Rogerson, 2018). This country, just like many others, is relying on foreign technologies and standards and it hinders local innovation (Wilson III, 2019). Economic dependency is caused by foreign influences as international tech companies limit local innovation and entrepreneurship and this normalizes colonial economic structures, and these practices prioritizes international markets over local needs (Ebong & Hanson, 2020) as mentioned by Amrute (2019) as well. This is true coming from a resident in SA, the nation has surrendered to giving developed countries power over the industry and because of this fact, people are not inspired to create technological innovations. The lack of encouragement shows that developers and engineers are not used to being major producers in tech, as there may be limited resources to create our own inventions in comparison to international countries that have control over what we have access to. It is clear that we may have the potential to do it, but developed countries want to stay at the “the top” of the global hierarchy created by themselves, therefore hindering our progressions in the industry.  There are other factors that hinder the growth and global competitiveness in the industry such as the educational and skills gap experienced in the IT sector. In the reading, “Bridging the Skills Gap in South Africa’s IT Sector” (Benjamin and Walton, 2020), the authors highlight how the South African economy struggles to provide students with necessary STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills and most of these foundational skills are crucial in IT careers, making it difficult for graduates to meet industry demands in the workforce. This analysis was released in the year 2020, before or during the pandemic which created a ‘shock’ leading to technological improvements as the nation had been forced to be part of the industrial revolution giving the tech industry a chance to develop because people witnessed how important it is. Therefore, there is still hope for change and contribution to decoloniality. The term decoloniality refers to the consistent efforts to create change by challenging persistent forms of coloniality. According to Zembylas (2018) the integration of humanising pedagogies and decolonizing pedagogies will dismantle colonial power structures in the context of South African higher education. Therefore, signifying that decoloniality has been challenged as SA continues to address the long-term effects of colonialism and may lead to transformative change.</p>
            <p>The role of South African software developers in decoloniality is to decolonize the tech industry by fostering independence and innovation. This may be through creating locally relevant technologies and inclusive tech ecosystems (Falola and Essien, 2017). Some insight on how local developers can engage in decolonial practices have been highlighted by the ICT sector along with the opportunities and challenges faced by developers in SA (Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, 2019). According to Thandeka Mkandawire (2020), educational reforms can inspire and empower local developers into critical thinking skills and knowledge to challenge decolonial legacies in technology. Tech hubs and local innovation will promote local tech solutions and it will contribute to decolonial practices by building an independent tech industry (Russon, 2019). It is important to note that Elon Musk is South African, and he has been dominating the tech industry over the years. If his innovations were developed in SA, it could have boosted the tech economy and may have contributed to increased job creation and investment opportunities. The country could have gained global recognition as a hub for technological innovation. </p>
            <p>However, drawing back to how the economy’s advancements are being controlled and how developed countries have power over what we have access to, perhaps Elon Musk felt like the lack of infrastructure and support for high tech industries may have hindered his potential. The ‘brain drain’ phenomenon highlights how talented individuals often seek opportunities abroad in more developed regions and it is a major concern (Docquier & Rapoport, 2012). Promoting and creating local content can empower SA developers and support decoloniality as it will reduce foreign dependency (Longe, 2018). In this digital age, social media has sparked attention to our country due to our creative drive and influence. Globally, our genre ‘amapiano’ gave rise to South Africa urging people to learn more about us. There are local developers posting about their development journeys and sharing their programming processes, mainly shared by people of colour. Therefore, content creation can assist in decoloniality and helps empower transformation. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, digital colonialism as described by Sareeta Amrute is valid and it offers a critical understanding of the colonial relationships experienced in the digital and tech industry. It has impacted South Africa as it poses significant challenges. However, there is potential for South African developers to participate in transformative practices to advocate for decoloniality by building an independent tech economy, promoting local innovation and dependency. </p>
