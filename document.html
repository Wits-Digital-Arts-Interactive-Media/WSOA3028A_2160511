            <p>This document will explain the design process focusing on brainstorming and the thought process for the website. It will mention the main purpose of the site including the type of topics that will be discussed in the blog posts. It will outline the challenges along with solutions and the general learning phase of creating the website such as the coding experience and getting familiar with the entire process of web development.</p>
            <p>First, I had to do research on Html. I started with getting familiar with Github, using visual code and making sure that my code is detected on the Github desktop app. When I finally saw that it worked, I would commit it and push to origin. During this process of changing and updating the code, I found that it was better to push to origin as the changes were made so that I am able to test the code and see if it worked on the actual website. Therefore, with every change…I went and checked the site. Checking the site on the Github website became tedious as takes too long to update so I found that I had better flow with the process of creating the site by rather checking any progress on the file that is saved in my file explorer. This is what I preferred and I saw my changes much quicker so I stopped relying on the github pages to see that. I also did not need to push to origin as much as before when starting out. I now only push when I feel I have completed the task. </p>
            <p>When I started, I had trouble with creating the title of the website. It ended up working after some time and then I created my first paragraph. I was testing this out to see how paragraphs work. I did not like the way the wording was not contained and just went on continuously. I needed it to look like it is contained so that it looks more organized. That is when I had to introduce some styling especially to represent the wireframe designs. I saw that we were not supposed to use styling but I felt like I had to learn it now so that I can get used to using that technique earlier on along my web development journey since it is my preference. I wanted an intro-page (the index page which is supposed to be the homepage that I changed later) I have seen websites having their homepage with an introduction to what the purpose of the website is. I have based mine on animation since I am extremely passionate about it. At first, I wanted to focus on the entire industry as a whole, but found that I would be discussing way too much in the blogs. Generally, companies that have websites are usually niche-based. Maybe I can add other topics such as gaming/ web development later on, but I felt that it would be better to stick to a niche for now and see how I would make it work for the blog posts.</p>
            <p>However, my profile will include my career. So, I intend on mentioning the other categories of my profession, then I’ll mention that I have chosen “animation” due to passion. For my profile image, I will have a graphic image of myself since it aligns with being a digital artist and it would make me feel pleased to have my own character. I will place this on the homepage so that viewers get to see the website and see the person behind it. Then I will have the portfolio with some graphic content, motion graphics, animations etc. I might include games. I will have some 3D assets as well. The contact page will have the phone number and email as well as a section for location. I’m not sure what the purpose of the contact section is for now since this is mainly a blog site so I do not know if I should encourage viewers to book me, making them customers instead, or to share feedback and comments. I might leave this part out later or I might choose to keep it once I have decided what to do.</p>
            <p>The blog posts are a bit intimidating for me because I feel like you have to keep readers focused and engaged. Therefore, the blog posts have to be interesting with the correct wording and grammar. I decided that dividing the posts with any graphic images is best to keep viewers engaged and making the images represent or further explain the content. It must be relatable to the post. Having different topics for the blog posts is also important and that is where I feel it is a bit difficult to produce all kinds of topics under the category of animation. So far, I have been brainstorming and this is what I currently think I will be writing about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The history of Animation</li>
                <li>Animation in Africa</li>
                <li>2D vs 3D animation</li>
                <li>Advantages & Disadvantages of being an Animator</li>
                <li>The truth about the industry</li>
                <li>Animation Studio scandals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another issue I had was how long the blog posts should be. Is it supposed to be an entire page? Should I rather make it short so that I can divide one of the topics into sub-categories and have more to write about? I did not know what is ideal, but I decided to make mine short especially because of time limitation.</p>
            <p>After making the decision on what type of website I want to create, the next step was the buttons. I did not care much about styling since it is not required at the moment. Having buttons to navigate to the other pages is important. I decided on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Blog Posts</li>
                <li>Portfolio</li>
                <li>Document</li>
                <li>Contact</li>
                <li>Essay</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Learning how to create the buttons was interesting, I had to first create new files. I first saw this in class and was confused as to how I’ll create it. I figured it out eventually, did a bit of research as well then added the navigation buttons to the code. I was so impressed when I saw the buttons on the page, making me feel like the website is coming together. This is because all the websites we see have buttons at the top of the page. It feels like something that is mandatory. Without it, it looks like a plain page with no context. It is truly what we are used to seeing that it does not make sense to not have it.</p>
            <p>The Blog posts took the longest to create and adding styling elements such as the container, sizing and padding really helped get the flow of creating the blogs. I just followed the same procedure for all the blog posts which is an heading and introduction and then the blogs be posted below under that specific topic. I have added the dates for each blog and made use of imagery to represent the discussions. I wish I could add more information in the blogs, some were not as informative as these were quick blogs that were made, but I feel there is room for improvement. I added links to the references for each blog and I found that it was challenging as some of the links did not work but I managed to copy links correctly so that it opens when clicked.</p>
            <p>My portfolio section has the wireframes with containers for images that will be added in the future. I did not know what other wireframes to do because the homepage, blog & contact section are already complete and they are in wireframe containers. I might make some changes to the font and appearance. I would also like to add a linked arrow to extend the blogs at the end of each blog post. So that the blog posts appear in an organized fashion and making the user engage with the blogs just from seeing the title only. The copyright footer was added as a test to see how I can make it work in the future.For the semantic markup, I ensured that I made use of section and articles instead of div in my code. It is much better to use as I can easily customize the container, size, font, padding, colour and margin.The code is much more accessible and easier to understand this way. </p>
