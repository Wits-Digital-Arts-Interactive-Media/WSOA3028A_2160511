            <h2 class="blog-title">A Journey through History</h2>
            <p class="blog-date">February 20, 2024</p>
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">The Early Beginnings</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">The roots of animation can be traced back to ancient times, where primitive forms of animation were used to depict movement and convey stories. One of the earliest examples of animation can be found in prehistoric cave paintings, where sequential images were painted to create the illusion of motion. <br>Fast forward to the 19th century, and we see the emergence of devices such as the zoetrope and the phenakistoscope, which used spinning disks with sequential images to create the illusion of motion when viewed through slits. These inventions laid the foundation for modern animation techniques.<br></p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">The Birth of Animation</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">The true birth of animation as we know it today can be credited to several pioneering individuals who made significant contributions to the art form. One such figure is Émile Cohl, a French artist who created the first animated film, "Fantasmagorie," in 1908. This groundbreaking film featured simple, hand-drawn animations that showcased the possibilities of the medium. </p>
            <img class="blog-image" src="Images/fantasmagorie.png" alt="sequential images">
            <p class="blog-content">Another key figure in the history of animation is Winsor McCay, an American cartoonist known for his iconic comic strips and animated films. McCay's animated short film "Gertie the Dinosaur" (1914) is considered one of the earliest examples of character animation and demonstrated the potential of animation as a storytelling medium.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Week 1 Content</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">Although I have added some of my first week experience in the documentation, I will add it here in depth. First, I had to do research on Html about the basics. I started getting familiar with GitHub and its interface. Learning about committing and pushing to origin. Seeing how it works simultaneously with GitHub online. When we started using visual studio code, the platform was unfamiliar to me as I was used to the platform I had used for game development. However, when researching how to create folders and starting the coding basics, I got used to it with time. I had to ensure that my vs code is detected on the GitHub desktop app where my changes are being displayed. When I finally saw that it worked, I would commit it and push to origin. During this process of changing and updating the code, I found that it was better to push to origin as the changes were made so that I can test the code and see if it worked on the actual website. Therefore, with every change…I went and checked the site. Checking the site on the GitHub website became tedious as it takes too long to update. Therefore, my workflow improved with the process of creating the site by checking any progress on the html files in the file explorer instead. When I click on them it redirects me to my pages. This is what I preferred, and I saw my changes much quicker, so I stopped relying on the GitHub website to see that. I noticed that when I make changes, it is best to commit after making the changes on each page as I have named my commits according to each page therefore making it easier to update each page one at a time.<br> <br> “Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world” (Cern Accelerating science) I enjoyed seeing images of the first web interface and seeing how it has progressed to what it is now. In the lecture content, they showed it to us as that is where I had first seen it. I managed to get the image from the CERN website. It went from introducing the first line-mode browser, then the WWW software on internet newsgroups and later went global. Next was the Mosaic browser after recruiting more tech professionals to work on the project. The web continued to grow, and the number of users increased to millions by 1994.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">The Golden Age of Animation</h2>
            <p class="blog-date">February 27, 2024</p>
            <p class="blog-content">The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of animation studios such as Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Animation, and Fleischer Studios, which produced iconic animated shorts and feature films that captivated audiences worldwide. Disney's "Steamboat Willie" (1928), featuring the debut of Mickey Mouse, marked the beginning of Disney's dominance in the animation industry.During this golden age of animation, innovations such as synchronized sound and Technicolor revolutionized the medium, allowing animators to create more immersive and visually stunning films. Classic animated films such as Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) and Warner Bros.' "Looney Tunes" shorts became cultural landmarks and inspired generations of animators and filmmakers.</p>
            <img class="blog-image" src="Images/MickeyMouse.jpg" >
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Modern Animation and Beyond</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">In the decades that followed, animation continued to evolve and diversify, with the advent of new technologies such as computer animation paving the way for groundbreaking films such as Pixar's "Toy Story" (1995), the world's first fully computer-animated feature film.</p>
            <img class="blog-image" src="Images/Toystory.jpeg" >
            <p class="blog-content">Today, animation is a thriving industry that encompasses a wide range of styles, techniques, and genres, from traditional hand-drawn animation to cutting-edge 3D animation and beyond. With the rise of streaming platforms and digital distribution channels, animation has become more accessible than ever, allowing creators from around the world to share their stories with global audiences.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Week 2 Content</h3>
            <img class="blog-image" src="Images/Early WF.png">
            <img class="blog-image" src="Images/Early WF 2.png">
            <p class="blog-content">This is my wireframe concept I created during the week. I have added button functionality as a primary goal to add to my UI due to organising my content into pages that the user can easily access. I am interested in adding a section that will notify the user about the current page being displayed. Followed by a title and descriptions about the purpose of the website such as what I will be discussing in my blogs and my profession. I want the profile content to be on the homepage at the bottom as it is what I have seen on multiple websites. I would like the profile to be one of the first things the user sees to help them get an insight into my skillset in the hopes to persuade them to engage more with the website and to create trustworthiness between me and the user. <br><br> As a beginner in web development, Moulthrop's insights provide an understanding of the transformative nature of hypertext and its impact on digital narratives. I noticed that his ideas highlight the importance of embracing interactivity and user-centred design. Hypertext promotes a shift from passive consumption to active participation, letting creators consider how users navigate and experience their digital creations. As I am at the beginning stages of web development, this perspective encourages us to prioritize user engagement and intuitive navigation in our designs.<br><br> Basically, the reading is about Moulthrop exploring the concept of hypertext and its implications within the broader context of media and storytelling. It is grounded in Marshall McLuhan's "Laws of Media," which are principles used to analyse the effects of media technologies in society. Moulthrop discusses hypertext as a revolutionary form of narrative structure that challenges traditional storytelling. Hypertext refers to text that is non-linear and interconnected through hyperlinks, allowing readers to navigate through content in non-sequential ways. He examines how hypertext offers new possibilities for user interaction and engagement. He considers how hypertext exemplifies McLuhan's Laws - specifically the principles ‘enhancement’ and ‘obsolescence’, he uses it to explore hypertext to outline its transformative capabilities and the impact it has on storytelling, making traditional linear narratives obsolete. He observed the significance of hypertext as a medium that challenges conventions and opens new possibilities for digital storytelling and user engagement. The reading has made me acknowledge the relationship between technology and narrative as the reading emphasizes the dynamic nature of media shaping our perceptions and experiences. </p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Week 3 Content</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">Interaction is the link between an active body and how it can affect something (Bardin 2013) and interface is a representation of that linking point (Geyser 2023). When analysing the lecture material, it significantly highlights the duty of interaction and how creators must implement strategies within their designs. When something is interactive it is responsive and requires nontrivial effort. Therefore, as I am designing my interface, I am being encouraged to think of designing ways to represent interaction in the system that users will engage with. Ixd refers to interaction design by considering the user experience which is what the user feels during an interaction. User interface is the visual element and interactivity of the website. Information architecture is the organisation and labelling of content to create the website. Creating goals is important throughout the development process by structuring information and deciding on the type of content I want whilst considering what the user wants. Interface elements such as input controls, navigational and informational components may be incorporated to represent the decisions made on the interface. Executing this ensures goal alignments according to the plans made beforehand. When executed properly it ensures that the user interface reflects what it needs to whilst creating an efficient user experience.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Week 4 Content</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">This week we dive deeper into user interface (UI) and user engagement (UX) by understanding how it is implemented, unpacking its differences, laws, and benefits. UX makes interfaces useful whilst helping users accomplish goals and UI makes it visually appealing and readable. The laws of UX include the Von Restorff effect which refers to an object that differs from multiple objects that are presented and is most likely remembered the most. Hicks law refers to the time it takes when making a choice as it depends on the number or complexity of choices present. I see this as the Takealot website, which is the one I have chosen to analyse for the essay. It has a sidebar representing the choices that customers may make if they choose to customize the page according to what they are looking for. For instance, if they only want 5-star rated products, they may click on the 5-star option and all the products under that category will be presented. If the customer is looking for a reasonable product, they may customize the products being displayed by adjusting the price range. Fitts Law refers to the time it takes to acquire a target which depends on the size and distance in which the target is placed. Therefore, the placement is important. An example that I have come up with through personal experience is having the “Add to cart” function at the bottom of the screen in a bold and large button. The button should still be present on the screen even when the user scrolls down to view all the information about the product. It encourages users to take action. Ziegarnik effect refers to users prioritizing uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. The use of progress bars visually represents when a task is incomplete, and I have seen this through my personal experience as well. I was working at a company in 2023, they gave us short modules to complete on an app and there were progress bars indicating an uncompletion or completion of that task. When it is indicated that it is uncomplete, you will be encouraged to finish the task to see the progress bar get full or reach 100%. Another element is incorporating percentages on the progress bars. It makes it more readable to the user as it helps them understand what level the progress bar is on and how much is remaining. If the progress is on 70%, the user knows there is 30% left of the task that needs to be complete. I was intrigued to find out what ‘call to action’ is as I have seen this everywhere on websites. CTA is a piece of content that encourages users to do something. Examples are sign up, subscribe, learn more, join us. I have come across so many “Sign up to our newsletter” commands and that is why I was fascinated when learning what CTA is because I have seen it several times. Then we further learn the principles of design which refers to design elements that will support the user interface as it is imperative that the creator takes the readability, size, location, appearance, scale, balance, alignment and more into account. Regarding the coding, semantic markup encourages programmers to have their code in a more organized fashion. I have made use of this by using articles and section in my code as I have been told through the lecture content that is not recommended to use divs and spans.</p>
