            <h2 class="blog-title">A Journey through History</h2>
            <p class="blog-date">February 20, 2024</p>
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">The Early Beginnings</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">The roots of animation can be traced back to ancient times, where primitive forms of animation were used to depict movement and convey stories. One of the earliest examples of animation can be found in prehistoric cave paintings, where sequential images were painted to create the illusion of motion. <br>Fast forward to the 19th century, and we see the emergence of devices such as the zoetrope and the phenakistoscope, which used spinning disks with sequential images to create the illusion of motion when viewed through slits. These inventions laid the foundation for modern animation techniques.<br></p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">The Birth of Animation</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">The true birth of animation as we know it today can be credited to several pioneering individuals who made significant contributions to the art form. One such figure is Émile Cohl, a French artist who created the first animated film, "Fantasmagorie," in 1908. This groundbreaking film featured simple, hand-drawn animations that showcased the possibilities of the medium. </p>

            <p class="blog-content">Another key figure in the history of animation is Winsor McCay, an American cartoonist known for his iconic comic strips and animated films. McCay's animated short film "Gertie the Dinosaur" (1914) is considered one of the earliest examples of character animation and demonstrated the potential of animation as a storytelling medium.</p>
